					30+ restaurants in 20 years, that’s no small attainment, but the prolific restaurateur Priyank Sukhija has done it, starting from the very young age of 19. Born in a family of lawyers, he became the only businessman in the family, opened the fine-dining restaurant Lazeez Affaire at Malcha Marg, in 1999. Beginning his journey with Lazeez Affaire, he created the most talked about brands in the hospitality industry- Lord of the Drinks, Plum by Bent Chair, Dragonfly Experience, JLWA, Tamasha, The Flying Saucer Cafe and many more. Coming from an era where people either opted for fine dining or clubbing, Priyank has been a true pioneer in building and popularizing the casual dining and successful in bringing a wave of innovation in the restaurant industry.
